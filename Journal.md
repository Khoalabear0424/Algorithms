### `isTreeSame()`
- Recursion is one of the most efficient ways to traverse a tree. If checking to see if two trees are identical, make sure to traverse the two trees at the same time and check the value at each node.
- No queues or arrays are needed to log these values as we are only checking for equality.

### Binary Heaps
Definition:
- MaxBinaryHeap Parent nodes are always larger than the child notes
- MinBinaryHeap Parent nodes are always smaller than the child notes
- Left children are filled out first
- No implied order between sibling nodes

Why do we need to know this?
- Binary heaps are used to implement Priority Qieues, very commonly used data structures
- A priority queue is a queue that stores data based on importance
